# Layout
 &nbsp;  &nbsp; The general structuring of each folder in rsc/ and proj/ goes like this
  ## &nbsp; My Custom Library
  <p> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; The <code>lib.c</code> and <code>lib.h</code> files contain my custom functions that I use frequently in each program.</p>
    
  ## &nbsp; Main Source File
  <p> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; The <code>c.c</code> program file that contains all the main code aside from function provided by my custom library.</p>

  ## &nbsp; Makefile
  <p> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; The <code>Makefile</code> file is the main tool that I use to run my code and handle git. 
  <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It runs multiple custom commands just by calling make executable in the command-line.</p>
